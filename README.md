# Stage201: PoC Design Doc (Internal)

MIT License © 2025 Motohiro Suzuki

---

**Stage201** provides an internal PoC design document plus an executable runner that:

- models deployment environments (QKD / Hybrid)
- defines operational profiles
- specifies failure behavior and logging
- binds PoC outputs to Stage191 CI evidence and Claim(required_jobs)

> Internal document. Not intended as a public-facing implementation spec.

---

## Purpose

This stage is a design-level executable specification.

It validates:

1. Operational profile consistency
2. Failure injection intent logging
3. Fail-closed binding to Stage191 CI results
4. Claim(required_jobs) satisfaction

This PoC does NOT implement a production protocol.
It ensures traceability and audit alignment.

---

## Fail-Closed Behavior

The runner exits with error if:

- Stage191 CI outputs are missing or unreadable
- Any Stage191 CI job failed
- Any claim’s required_jobs is not satisfied
- A profile invariant is violated
- Failure injection is requested but profile disallows it

No "green PoC log" can exist without green CI evidence.

## Requirements

Python 3.10+

Optional dependency:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pyyaml
Run
Baseline (no failure)
python3 runtime/poc_runner.py --profile hybrid_balanced --failure none
tail -n 30 out/poc_logs/poc.jsonl
Inject failure (resilience_test only)
python3 runtime/poc_runner.py --profile resilience_test --failure downgrade
tail -n 50 out/poc_logs/poc.jsonl
